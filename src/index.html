            <p class="poem">
                She sang, and I listened the whole song thro'.<br>
                (It was sweet, so sweet, the singing.)<br>
                The stars were out and the moon it grew<br>
                From a wee soft glimmer way out in the blue<br>
                To a bird thro' the heavens winging.<br><br>

                She sang, and the song trembled down to my breast,--<br>
                (It was sweet, so sweet the singing.)<br>
                As a dove just out of its fledgling nest,<br>
                And, putting its wings to the first sweet test,<br>
                Flutters homeward so wearily winging..<br><br>

                She sang and I said to my heart "That song,<br>
                That was sweet, so sweet i' the singing,<br>
                Shall live with us and inspire us long,<br>
                And thou, my heart, shalt be brave and strong<br>
                For the sake of those words a-winging."<br><br>

                The woman died and the song was still.<br>
                (It was sweet, so sweet, the singing.)<br>
                But ever I hear the same low trill,<br>
                Of the song that shakes my heart with a thrill,<br>
                And goes forever winging.
